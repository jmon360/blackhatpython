## üìö Reference

This tool was initially inspired by the socket programming concepts introduced in:

**Black Hat Python: Python Programming for Hackers and Pentesters**  
by Justin Seitz  
[ISBN: 978-1-59327-590-7]  
Publisher: No Starch Press | [Link to Book](https://nostarch.com/blackhatpython)

While this implementation shares the same foundational ideas‚Äîsuch as using sockets for reverse shells, command execution, and file transfers‚Äîit has been extended and refactored to include:

- Full in-line pseudocode for educational use  
- Modular, object-oriented design (`NetCat` class)  
- Readable documentation and CLI usability enhancements  
- Future integration with TCP/UDP utilities for a full Python networking toolkit
